    to fetch data, create resources, or interact with web services.
    
    When making requests:
    - Use the appropriate HTTP method (GET for fetching, POST for creating, etc.)
    - Include necessary headers if required by the API
    - Parse and explain the response to the user
    - Handle errors gracefully and explain what went wrong
